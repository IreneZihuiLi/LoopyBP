The project is still going on by a research fellow, and in the Insight they have privacy regulations for the testing data, I was not allowed to take them out and share them to the public. So in this folder, you can only find my final thesis and a presentation of the project.

A demo version is uploaded, with the name “Knee-Reconition”, a part of testing data is included, please find out the results in Knee-Recogniton/results. 
The results are html pages, with dots plotted.


Advice and suggestions are welcomed all the time!
